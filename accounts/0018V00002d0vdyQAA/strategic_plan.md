## Executive Summary

**ICP Fit Score**: 9/10 — 🔴 TOP PRIORITY

| Criteria | Score | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Company Size & Revenue | 3/3 | $137.7M revenue, 70+ stores, multi-market — solidly in Large Accounts ICP |
| Industry Fit & Use Case | 2/2 | Premium beauty retail = perfect vertical fit (Charlotte Tilbury, Rare Beauty precedents) |
| Growth Signals & Triggers | 2/2 | PE ownership driving cost optimization + likely SFCC renewal window NOW + new CEO with digital platform DNA |
| Technical Fit (Platform Pain) | 2/2 | SFCC for 6-7 years = peak pain (cost, speed, omnichannel gap for 70+ stores) |
| Engagement Potential | 0/1 | 179 emails, 0 replies — but all were event spam, never personalized 1:1. Deducting here but confident a fresh approach will land. |

**Recommendation**: ⚡ **PURSUE IMMEDIATELY** — This is a top-tier prospect hiding in plain sight.

**TL;DR**: Space NK is a $137.7M luxury beauty retailer stuck on Salesforce Commerce Cloud ($2M+/year) with 70+ disconnected stores, a PE owner demanding cost efficiency, and a new CEO (Andy Lightfoot) who comes from THG and deeply understands platform economics. We've never actually *talked* to them — 179 emails over 2.5 years were all generic event invitations. A completely fresh, personalized, executive-level approach anchored on the Charlotte Tilbury migration story ($6.8M savings, same vertical, same platform) and unified commerce for 70+ stores could unlock a $500K–$800K+ ACV opportunity with $6.8M in 5-year savings as the headline.

---

## 1. Account Context

### Company Overview
Space NK is a UK-based premium multi-brand beauty retailer founded in 1993, now operating 70+ stores across the UK, Ireland, and USA. They curate high-end beauty brands including NARS, Drunk Elephant, Charlotte Tilbury, Hourglass, and Olaplex. Revenue is approximately $137.7M. They are owned by **Manzanita Capital**, a private equity firm — meaning cost optimization, operational efficiency, and potential exit preparation are constant boardroom themes.

### Recent Developments & Triggers

| # | Trigger Event | Why It Matters | Timing Implication |
|---|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **SFCC Contract Likely at Renewal** | 6-7 years on SFCC = at or past typical 3-5 year renewal cycle. Renewal windows are the #1 moment companies evaluate alternatives. | **NOW — Q1/Q2 2026 is the window.** If they re-sign, we lose 3-5 years. |
| 2 | **Andy Lightfoot appointed CEO** | Ex-THG Beauty President — ran operations on THG's proprietary Ingenuity platform. Understands platform economics, TCO, and the pain of monolithic systems intimately. | Opens a door for a platform conversation at the highest level. |
| 3 | **PE Ownership (Manzanita Capital)** | PE firms demand cost efficiency and margin improvement. $1.37M/year in platform savings drops straight to EBITDA — a PE investor's dream metric. | Every board meeting is an opportunity for "why are we spending $2M on SFCC?" |
| 4 | **70+ Stores with Online Channel** | Omnichannel unification is the industry mega-trend. SFCC cannot natively unify POS + online. Shopify can. | Physical retail expansion creates more pain on a disconnected stack. |
| 5 | **Charlotte Tilbury Migration Success** | Same vertical (luxury beauty), same previous platform (SFCC), same geography (UK) — migrated to Shopify Plus. 60% faster launches, $6.8M saved over 5 years. | The single most powerful proof point we can deploy. Peer pressure in the beauty industry is real. |

### Strategic Priorities (Inferred)
1. **Cost Optimization** → Shopify delivers $1.37M/year savings (65% lower TCO than SFCC)
2. **Omnichannel Unification** → Shopify POS + Online natively unified across 70+ stores
3. **Speed to Market** → Launch campaigns in hours/days vs. 3-6 months on SFCC
4. **International Growth** → Shopify Markets enables multi-market expansion without separate SFCC instances
5. **Exit Readiness** → Modern, scalable tech stack increases enterprise value for PE exit

---

## 2. Salesforce History & Risk Assessment

### Past Engagement
- **Status**: Net-New Prospect — **ZERO Shopify presence**
- **Past Opportunities**: NONE created — no pipeline, no demos, no meetings, no calls
- **Outreach Volume**: 179 emails sent over ~2.5 years
- **Response Rate**: **0%** (zero replies to any outreach)
- **Last Contact**: December 3, 2025 (85 days ago)
- **Outreach Type**: 100% event invitations — Ecom Expo, Rugby Micro Event, Women in Leadership, Beyonce event
- **Personalized 1:1 Outreach**: NEVER attempted

### What NOT to Repeat
⚠️ **CRITICAL LESSONS FROM FAILURE:**
1. ❌ **No more mass event invitations** — 179 emails of event spam created brand fatigue, not interest
2. ❌ **No more impersonal outreach** — Every email was marketing-led, none were personalized to a stakeholder's specific role or challenges
3. ❌ **No more marketing-only approach** — Zero sales-led, 1:1 executive engagement was ever attempted
4. ❌ **Do not reference past outreach** — Treat this as if we've never contacted them. The 85-day gap is sufficient cooling.

### Risk Level: 🟡 MEDIUM

**Why Medium (not Low):**
- 179 unanswered emails could have created negative brand association ("Shopify = spam")
- We don't know if any stakeholders actively dislike Shopify due to the volume
- 37% of contacts are archived — possible turnover or data decay

**Why Not High:**
- No actual negative sales interactions (no demos gone wrong, no closed-lost deals)
- All outreach was generic event invites — likely ignored/filtered, not actively resented
- 85-day cooling period provides a clean break
- Fresh approach with personalized, value-led messaging is a complete reset

### 🎯 PRIMARY TARGET #1: Andy Lightfoot — CEO

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Role** | Economic Buyer / Executive Sponsor |
| **Why First** | CEO with THG Beauty background = understands platform economics deeply. THG built & ran its own proprietary platform (Ingenuity) — Andy lived the build-vs-buy, platform cost, and scalability conversation. He won't need convincing that platform choice matters; he needs convincing Shopify is the right choice. |
| **In SFDC?** | ❌ **NO — Must be added immediately** |
| **Confidence** | HIGH (confirmed via Companies House + press coverage) |
| **Background** | Former President of THG Beauty (The Hut Group). THG is a ~$2B+ digital commerce group. Appointed CEO of Space NK by Manzanita Capital. |
| **Outreach Hook** | "Andy — given your experience scaling THG Beauty on Ingenuity, I imagine you have a sharp perspective on platform economics. Charlotte Tilbury just completed their migration off SFCC to Shopify Plus and saved $6.8M over 5 years. I'd love 15 minutes to share what we're seeing in the premium beauty space." |
| **Channel** | LinkedIn InMail first (Week 1) → Personalized email (Week 1, Day 3) → Follow-up with Charlotte Tilbury case study (Week 2) |
| **Warm Intro Path** | Check if Jessica Kohl (Printemps deal owner) or Gabrielle Gant (EMEA luxury ABM) have connections. Check LinkedIn for mutual connections via THG network. |
| **Email Pattern** | Try: andy.lightfoot@spacenk.com, a.lightfoot@spacenk.com |

---

### 🎯 PRIMARY TARGET #2: Margaret Mitchell — Chief Digital Officer (VERIFY)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Role** | Champion / Technical Decision Maker |
| **Why Target** | CDO owns the digital commerce stack. If she exists in this role, she's the person living the SFCC pain daily and would champion a migration. |
| **In SFDC?** | ❌ **NO — Must be verified on LinkedIn and added** |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM — verify title and current employment |
| **Outreach Hook** | "Margaret — we've been working with several luxury beauty brands who were spending 60-70% more than necessary on their commerce platform. I'd love to share what Charlotte Tilbury's team discovered about speed-to-market when they moved off SFCC." |
| **Channel** | LinkedIn connection request with personalized note → Email follow-up |

---

### 🎯 SECONDARY TARGET #3: CTO (Name in SFDC)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Role** | Technical Buyer / Potential Blocker |
| **Why Target** | CTOs on SFCC often have teams built around the platform. Could champion (if frustrated with SFCC complexity) or block (if invested in current stack). |
| **In SFDC?** | ✅ YES — last activity 91 days ago |
| **Outreach Hook** | "I know SFCC teams spend significant cycles on upgrades and maintenance. We've been helping companies like Charlotte Tilbury redirect those engineering hours toward innovation instead of infrastructure. Would a technical architecture conversation be useful?" |
| **Risk** | May be emotionally invested in SFCC. Approach with respect for current architecture. Frame as "evolution" not "replacement." |

---

### 🎯 SECONDARY TARGET #4: Head of Customer Experience (Most Engaged)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Role** | Influencer / Internal Champion |
| **Why Target** | Most recently active contact (77 days ago). CX leaders feel omnichannel pain acutely — customers don't get consistent experience across 70+ stores and online. |
| **In SFDC?** | ✅ YES — most recently engaged |
| **Outreach Hook** | "With 70+ stores and a growing online business, I'd imagine creating a seamless customer experience across every touchpoint is a constant priority. We've been helping retailers like Printemps unify their in-store and online experience on a single platform." |

---

### 🎯 SECONDARY TARGET #5: Chief Commercial Officer

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Role** | Business Influencer |
| **Why Target** | Owns commercial outcomes — revenue growth, margin improvement. The $1.37M/year cost savings and faster campaign launches directly impact their metrics. |
| **In SFDC?** | ✅ YES — last activity 118 days ago |
| **Outreach Hook** | "Premium beauty brands on Shopify Plus are launching campaigns in hours instead of weeks and seeing 2x mobile conversion improvements. I'd love to share the commercial impact we've seen in your vertical." |

---

### Multi-Threading Strategy

```
WEEK 1: Open two doors simultaneously
├── CEO Andy Lightfoot (LinkedIn InMail — executive-to-executive tone)
└── Head of CX (Email — operational pain, omnichannel hook)

WEEK 2: Expand the thread
├── CTO (Technical architecture angle — email)
├── CDO Margaret Mitchell (If verified — LinkedIn + email)
└── Follow-up CEO with Charlotte Tilbury case study

WEEK 3: Triangulate
├── Chief Commercial Officer (Commercial impact angle)
├── CFO (TCO/ROI angle — only if engagement from others)
└── Follow-up all active threads

WEEK 4+: Consolidate
├── Propose a 30-minute executive briefing
├── Offer Charlotte Tilbury reference call
└── Introduce SE for technical conversation if CTO engaged
```

### Coverage Analysis

✅ **We HAVE coverage in**: CEO office, CTO, CMO, CFO, CX, Commercial
❌ **We are MISSING (critical gaps to fill)**:
- **Head of eCommerce** — #1 champion candidate, lives in SFCC daily
- **Head of Retail Operations** — owns 70+ stores, POS decision influence
- **Procurement** — will run vendor selection process
- **Head of Digital Product** — owns roadmap, technical evaluation
- **Data/Analytics** — verify Sarah Thompson

**Action Required**: LinkedIn research sprint to identify and add these 4-5 missing stakeholders before outreach begins.

## 4. Value Proposition & Positioning

### Current Platform Analysis

| Dimension | Space NK on SFCC Today | Pain Level |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| **Annual Cost** | ~$2M/year (license + SI + hosting + maintenance) | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Speed to Market** | 3-6 months for major campaigns; 6-12 weeks for features | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Omnichannel** | Online and 70+ stores on separate systems | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Developer Talent** | SFCC devs: scarce, £80K-£120K+, niche skillset | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| **International** | Each new market requires separate SFCC instance | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| **Upgrades** | Major projects requiring SI involvement and testing | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Innovation** | Limited app ecosystem, all customization is custom-built | 🟡 MEDIUM |

### Shopify Positioning: The Three "Whys"

#### WHY CHANGE
> "You're spending $2M+/year on a platform that takes months to launch campaigns, can't unify your 70+ stores with online, and requires expensive specialists to maintain. Every day on SFCC is a day your competitors are moving faster."

**Key proof**: Charlotte Tilbury — same industry, same previous platform — saved $6.8M over 5 years and now launches in hours not months.

#### WHY SHOPIFY
> "Shopify Plus gives you a single unified platform for all 70+ stores AND online, with automatic upgrades, 10,000+ apps, and a developer ecosystem 10x larger than SFCC. You'll spend 65% less and move 10x faster."

**Key differentiators for Space NK:**
1. **Shopify POS** — Natively unified with online, perfect for 70+ stores
2. **Shopify Markets** — Multi-market international expansion without separate instances
3. **10,000+ Apps** — vs. building everything custom on SFCC
4. **Automatic Upgrades** — No more major upgrade projects
5. **14% GMV Lift** — Merchants using Shopify's in-person support see measurable lift

#### WHY NOW
> "Your SFCC contract is likely approaching renewal. If you re-sign for another 3-5 years, that's $6.8M in savings you'll never recover. Manzanita Capital's board will ask why platform costs didn't come down."

**Urgency factors:**
- SFCC renewal window = NOW (6-7 years in, past typical contract cycle)
- PE exit timeline = cost optimization is a board-level priority
- Charlotte Tilbury already moved = competitive pressure in the vertical
- Every month on SFCC = ~$115K in excess platform spend

### Proof Points & Social Proof

| # | Customer | Relevance | Result |
|---|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Charlotte Tilbury** | Same vertical (luxury beauty), same previous platform (SFCC), same geography (UK) | 60% faster launches, $6.8M saved over 5 years, 35% cost reduction Year 1, 2x mobile conversion |
| 2 | **Printemps NYC** | French luxury department store, multi-brand retailer, unified commerce (POS + online) | Chose Shopify for unified omnichannel across physical + digital |
| 3 | **ALDO Group** | Multi-brand retailer, thousands of stores, massive omnichannel | Enterprise-grade unified commerce at scale |
| 4 | **Rare Beauty** | Premium beauty brand, beauty-specific tech innovation (AI "magic mirror") | Innovation velocity on Shopify platform |
| 5 | **MediaMarkt** | Europe's largest electronics retailer, $22B GMV potential | Proof of enterprise-scale European migration |

---

## 5. Whitespace & Opportunity Sizing

### Products Space NK Could Buy

| Product | Fit | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|-----|----------|-----------|
| **Shopify Plus** (Online Store) | 🔴 Critical | 🔴 Primary | Replace SFCC for spacenk.com — the core migration |
| **Shopify POS** (70+ stores) | 🔴 Critical | 🔴 Co-Primary | Unified commerce is THE killer differentiator. 70+ stores = massive POS footprint |
| **Shopify Markets** | 🟡 High | 🟡 Phase 2 | UK + Ireland + USA = multi-market. SFCC requires separate instances per market; Markets handles this natively |
| **Shopify B2B** | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Phase 2 | If Space NK does wholesale to other retailers or corporate gifting |
| **Shopify Audiences** | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Phase 2 | Customer acquisition efficiency — PE owner would love improved CAC |
| **Shop Pay** | 🟢 Add-on | 🟢 With Launch | Accelerated checkout = higher conversion |
| **Shopify Flow** | 🟢 Add-on | 🟢 With Launch | Automation to replace custom SFCC workflows |

### Estimated ACV

| Component | Estimate | Basis |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Shopify Plus (Online) | $300K–$400K/year | $137.7M revenue, premium tier |
| Shopify POS (70+ locations) | $150K–$250K/year | 70+ stores at enterprise POS pricing |
| Shopify Markets | $50K–$100K/year | Multi-market (UK, Ireland, USA) |
| **Entry ACV** | **$500K–$750K/year** | Plus + POS + Markets |
| **Expansion ACV** | **$100K–$150K/year** | B2B, Audiences, additional markets |
| **Total Potential** | **$600K–$900K/year** | Full platform |

### 5-Year Value Narrative for Space NK

| Metric | SFCC (Stay) | Shopify Plus (Switch) | Delta |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| 5-Year Platform Cost | $10M+ | $3.14M | **-$6.8M savings** |
| Year 1 Cost (incl. migration) | $2M+ | ~$928K (incl. $300K migration) | **-$1.07M Year 1** |
| Campaign Launch Time | 3-6 months | Hours to days | **10-50x faster** |
| Mobile Conversion | Baseline | +100% (2x improvement per CT) | **Revenue uplift** |
| Omnichannel | Disconnected | Unified POS + Online | **Single customer view** |

### Outreach Sequence

#### WEEK 1: Open the Door

**Step 1A: LinkedIn Connection — CEO Andy Lightfoot** (Monday)
> *Connection request note (300 chars max):*
>
> "Andy — congrats on the Space NK role. Given your experience building THG Beauty's digital operations, I thought you might find our work with UK luxury beauty brands relevant. Would love to connect."

**Step 1B: LinkedIn InMail — Andy Lightfoot** (Monday, if InMail available)
> "Andy — I lead enterprise partnerships for luxury retail at Shopify across Northern Europe. Given your background scaling THG Beauty, I imagine you have a sharp perspective on platform economics and what drives real operational efficiency.
>
> Charlotte Tilbury recently completed their migration from Salesforce Commerce Cloud to Shopify Plus — saving $6.8M over 5 years while launching campaigns 60% faster. As a fellow premium beauty brand with 70+ stores, I thought their story might resonate.

> Running customer experience across 70+ retail locations and an online business is no small feat — especially when the systems aren't talking to each other.
>
> We've been working with luxury retailers like Printemps to unify their in-store and online customer experience on a single platform. The result: one customer view, one inventory, one experience — no matter where the customer shops.
>
> Would a 15-minute call to explore what this could look like for Space NK be worthwhile?
>
> Best,
> Shiv"

**Step 1D: Email — CEO Andy Lightfoot** (Wednesday — 2 days after LinkedIn)

> "Andy,
>
> I reached out on LinkedIn earlier this week — wanted to follow up with a bit more context.
>
> Charlotte Tilbury was in a similar position to Space NK not long ago: a premium UK beauty brand running on Salesforce Commerce Cloud, spending significantly on a platform that was slowing them down. They made the switch to Shopify Plus and within the first year saw:
>
> • 35% reduction in platform costs
> • 60% faster campaign launches
> • 2x improvement in mobile conversion
> • $6.8M in savings projected over 5 years
>
> With your experience at THG — where platform choice was core to the business model — I imagine you think about these economics often. I'd love 15 minutes to share what we're seeing in the premium beauty space and hear your perspective.
>
> Would next week work?

> Best,
> Shiv Patel
> Enterprise Partnerships, Shopify | Northern Europe"

---

#### WEEK 2: Multi-Thread & Follow Up

**Step 2A: Email — CTO** (Monday)

>
> "[Name],
>
> I work with enterprise engineering teams across EMEA who are evaluating their commerce platform architecture — particularly those on Salesforce Commerce Cloud.
>
> The consistent feedback we hear: too much engineering time spent on upgrades, maintenance, and fighting the platform, not enough on building customer-facing innovation.
>
> I'd love to share a technical architecture overview of how brands like Charlotte Tilbury approached their migration — and what their engineering team got back in terms of velocity and focus.
>
> Worth a 20-minute technical conversation?
>
> Best,
> Shiv"

**Step 2B: Follow-Up — CEO Andy Lightfoot** (Wednesday)
> Subject: "Re: Charlotte Tilbury's $6.8M platform decision"

>
> The short version: brands your size are typically spending $1.3M+ more per year than they need to on their commerce platform.
>

>
> Shiv"

## 8. Risk Factors & Objections

### Anticipated Objections

| # | Objection | Counter |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | *"We just renewed our SFCC contract"* | "Many brands start the evaluation 12-18 months before contract end. Even if you've renewed, understanding the alternative helps you negotiate future terms and plan a migration timeline. We can build the business case now for your next renewal window." |
| 2 | *"Migration is too risky / disruptive"* | "Charlotte Tilbury did it — same platform, same industry, same complexity. We support phased rollouts so you can migrate market-by-market, starting with the lowest-risk region. We'll share their migration playbook." |
| 3 | *"Our team is built around SFCC"* | "Shopify developers are 3x more abundant and 40-50% less expensive than SFCC specialists. Your team's commerce knowledge transfers — they just get to work in a modern, faster platform. We provide migration training and support." |
| 4 | *"Shopify is for small businesses"* | "Charlotte Tilbury, Printemps, ALDO Group, MediaMarkt ($22B GMV) — these are enterprise brands running on Shopify Plus. Our Enterprise tier is purpose-built for complex, high-volume retailers." |
| 5 | *"We need to focus on other priorities right now"* | "Every month on SFCC costs ~$115K more than it needs to. A 15-minute call to understand the economics doesn't require any commitment — it just gives you data for better decisions." |
| 6 | *"We need B2B / wholesale capabilities"* | "Shopify B2B is built natively into the platform — same backend, same inventory, same customer data. No separate instance needed like SFCC." |
| 7 | *"Our PE investors want stability, not risk"* | "PE investors want margin improvement. $1.37M/year in cost savings drops straight to EBITDA. And Shopify's automatic upgrades mean less operational risk, not more — no more major upgrade projects." |

### Blockers to Watch For

| Blocker | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **SFCC Account Team** — Salesforce will fight hard to retain. They may offer heavy discounts or extended terms. | Lead with value, not just cost. Emphasize speed, omnichannel, and innovation that SFCC can't match at any price. |
| **Existing SI Partner** — Space NK's SFCC system integrator has revenue at stake and will resist. | Understand who the SI is early. Some SIs (like Valtech, BORN) now also have Shopify practices. |
| **Internal SFCC Champions** — Developers or architects who built their career on the platform. | Engage CTO early. Frame as career growth (modern platform, larger ecosystem) not threat. |
| **PE Timeline Conflict** — If Manzanita is planning an imminent exit (<6 months), they may freeze all technology changes. | Position migration as value creation for exit: modern tech stack increases enterprise value. |
| **Contractual Lock-in** — SFCC may have penalties for early termination. | Shopify's savings often cover early termination fees. Offer TCO analysis including exit costs. |
